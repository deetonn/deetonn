### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Developer based in the north west of England. I just enjoy programming, doesn't matter the language. 

Take a look through my projects, though beware alot of my stuff on here is purely recreational. Feel free to check out projects I developed and maintain, such as my Mum's website [Ive Been Autistic All Along?](https://ivebeenautisticallalong.com), or my personal project at [deeton.xyz](https://deeton.xyz).

Looking to contact me? Add my discord `@speccylad`

Are you really professional and would like to contact me via email? Send it to `deetonrushy@gmail.com`, however I don't check it much, so beware that I may just not see it.
